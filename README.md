## 🚀 What is UCP?

**Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)** is an **open-source protocol** that standardizes how AI agents, merchants, platforms, and payment systems interact across the full commerce lifecycle — from product discovery to post-purchase support.

### Key Features

- **Transport Agnostic**: Works via REST APIs, MCP (Model Context Protocol), A2A (Agent2Agent), or JSON-RPC
- **Composable Architecture**: Modular capabilities (Checkout, Orders, Catalog) with independent versioning
- **Merchant-First**: Retailers remain Merchant of Record with full customer data ownership
- **Payment Flexible**: Compatible with AP2 (Agent Payments Protocol) for secure agentic payments
- **Open & Extensible**: Community-driven with Apache 2.0 license

### What Problem Does UCP Solve?

**The N×N Integration Problem**

Without UCP:
- ❌ Custom integration for ChatGPT
- ❌ Custom integration for Google Gemini  
- ❌ Custom integration for Microsoft Copilot
- ❌ Custom integration for every AI platform
- ❌ Unsustainable complexity

With UCP:
- ✅ Single protocol implementation
- ✅ Works across all UCP-enabled AI platforms
- ✅ Standardized discovery, checkout, and fulfillment
- ✅ Future AI platforms automatically compatible

### Official Information

- **Website:** https://ucp.dev
- **Specification:** https://ucp.dev/specification/overview/
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol
- **License:** Apache 2.0
- **Version:** 2026-01-11



## 💡 Why UCP Matters

### The Shift to Agentic Commerce

**Traditional E-commerce:**
```
User searches → Clicks link → Browses site → Adds to cart → Checkout
```

**Agentic Commerce:**
```
User asks AI → AI discovers product → AI presents options → AI completes purchase
```

### Market Context (Verified Data)

According to **Salesforce Cyber Week 2025 Report** (November 25 - December 1, 2025):
- **$336.6 billion** in global sales
- **$67 billion** (20%) influenced by AI agents
- AI drove personalized recommendations and conversational service
- Retailers with agents saw **32% faster** sales growth
