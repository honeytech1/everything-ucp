## 🚀 What is UCP?

**Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)** is an open-source protocol that enables seamless commerce across AI agents and platforms. Think of it as the "HTTP for AI shopping" — it defines standard building blocks for:

- 🔍 **Product Discovery**: How AI agents find your products
- 🛒 **Cart & Checkout**: Completing purchases within AI conversations
- 📦 **Order Management**: Post-purchase tracking and support
- 💳 **Secure Payments**: Cryptographically verified transactions

### Key Features

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Transport Agnostic** | Works via REST APIs, MCP, A2A protocols |
| **Merchant-First** | You remain Merchant of Record with full data ownership |
| **Payment Flexible** | Compatible with Google Pay, PayPal, Stripe, and more |
| **Open & Extensible** | Community-driven, Apache 2.0 licensed |
| **Production Ready** | Launched January 2025 with 20+ major partners |

## 💡 Why UCP Matters for Your Business

### The Shift to Agentic Commerce

Traditional e-commerce: `User searches → Clicks link → Browses site → Adds to cart → Checkout`

Agentic commerce: `User asks AI → AI discovers → AI presents → AI completes purchase`

**According to Salesforce:** AI and agents drove ~20% of retail sales ($272B globally) during 2025 holiday season.

### The Integration Problem UCP Solves

**Without UCP:**
- ❌ Build custom integration for ChatGPT
- ❌ Build another for Google Gemini  
- ❌ Build another for Microsoft Copilot
- ❌ Build another for Claude
- ❌ N × N integration complexity

**With UCP:**
- ✅ Single protocol implementation
- ✅ Works across all UCP-enabled AI platforms
- ✅ Standardized discovery, checkout, and fulfillment
- ✅ Future platforms automatically compatible

### Business Benefits

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Expanded Reach** | Access high-intent shoppers in AI Mode, Gemini, ChatGPT |
| **Reduced Cart Abandonment** | Frictionless checkout within conversations |
| **Lower Integration Costs** | One implementation vs. multiple custom builds |
| **Customer Data Ownership** | Remain Merchant of Record, keep all customer relationships |
| **Dynamic Personalization** | Real-time pricing, loyalty, and offers in AI context |
